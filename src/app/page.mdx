## About

AS3CoreAddendum is an architectural addendum to the core of the Actionscript 3.0 language. It&#39;s based on some standards and patterns of Java and C# languages. It aims to be a base standard library for basically any AS3 application or framework.

For most AS3 developers, there&#39;s nothing wrong with the core of the language, and such a library doesn&#39;t add value. But any experienced AS3 developer concerned with good code and consequently with a good object-oriented design and design patterns knows that AS3 leaves much to be desired when it comes to advanced OO concepts.

That&#39;s where AS3CoreAddendum comes in: it adds some classes and interfaces to enhance the core language. As a result, it allows a better OO design through the implementation of patterns for solving common problems in advanced OO scenarios, such as:

- Dispose an object (_IDisposable_)
- Clone an object (_ICloneable_)
- Implement comparators (_IComparator_)
- Implement enumerations (_Enum_)
- Implement object equality by value (not only by reference) (_IEquatable_)
- And more...

All of this through a standardized, documented, and unit-tested library.

For more information, see the docs.
